== Requirements ==

Note that the version numbers supplied here are those
used in developing the library, you might get away with
lower version numbers in some cases (i.e boost dependencies
are probably of version 1.37). 

for building:
* scons                         1.0

library dependencies:
* HLHDF library                 0.7.7
* boost::iterator               1.38
* boost::lexical_cast           1.38
* boost::smart_ptr              1.38
* boost::utility                1.38
* boost::variant                1.38
* QtCore                        4.5
* QtSql                         4.5

additional test dependencies:
* gtest                         1.4.0
* gmock                         1.4.0

run time dependencies:
* postgresql driver for qt4-sql
* postgresql                    8.3

documentation generation dependencies:
* doxygen

all boost libraries used are header only


== generating documentation ==

 $ scons doc



== building ==

to get a list of available variables:

 $ scons --help

You should probably specify installation prefix (the default is '/usr/local')
and paths for any libraries you have installed somewhere other than '/usr'.

Specified variables are cached in 'variables.cache' in distribution's root
directory.

The default is to build with no debugging symbols and to generate java
bindings.

just to give an example, the following is equivalent to default build:

 $ scons prefix=/usr/local debug=no build_java=yes



== running unit tests ==

You can build unit test runner and run it, using target 'test'. To be able
to run all tests, you should define 'test_db_dsn' variable. If you don't,
only tests not dependent on database are compiled.
 
 $ scons test test_db_dsn=postgresql://baltrad:baltrad@localhost/baltrad




== installing ==

If all is in order, feel free to install the library:

 $ scons install

To actually be of any use, you should also create a database. Table creation
statements can be found in schema/postgresql/create.sql. Just feed the file
to the database and you should be set to go.

 $ createdb baltrad
 $ psql < ./schema/postgresql/create.sql
