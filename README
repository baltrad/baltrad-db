About
-----

BDB is part of the Baltrad project, providing storage, retrieval and queries
for ODIM/H5 compliant files to other parts of the system.


Structure
---------

This project is divided into several subdirectories:

* **common** contains a python library for functionality shared between the
  python server and client
* **server** contains the python implementation of the BDB server
* **client/python** contains the python client
* **client/java** contains the java client
* **doc** contains the general documentation, as well as documentation for
  python packages :py:mod:`baltrad.bdbcommon`, :py:mod:`baltrad.bdbclient`
  and :py:mod:`baltrad.bdbserver`
* **misc** contains miscellaneous utilites distributed alongside this library

Setting up a development environment
------------------------------------

The most convenient way to set up an environment for BDB development is to
use virtualenv. There is one in misc/virtualenv.

Set up an and activate an environment in ./env ::

 $ ./misc/virtualenv/virtualenv.py --distribute --system-site-packages ./env
 $ source ./env/bin/activate

See virtualenv documentation for a more thorough reference.

Software written in python makes use of `sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_
for documentation and `nose <http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/>`_ for testing,
so it would be useful to install these in the enviromnent as well.

It might also be a good idea to include
`mock <http://code.google.com/p/mock/>`_

::

 $ pip install "nose >= 1.1"
 $ pip install "sphinx >= 1.1"

 $ pip install "mock >= 0.7"

Generating documentation
------------------------

::
 
 $ cd doc
 $ make html


Installing the packages
-----------------------

.. note::

  If you are installing python packages for development you might want
  to use `develop` command instead of `install`. This will add the source
  directory to :py:data:`sys.path` instead of copying the files and your
  changes will be picked up automatically.

common::
 
 $ cd common
 $ python setup.py install

server::

 $ cd server
 $ python setup.py install

python client::

 $ cd client/python
 $ python setup.py install

java client::

 $ cd client/java
 $ ant install
